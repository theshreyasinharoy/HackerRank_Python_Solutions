# Python: Division

### Task

#### The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

#### Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a//b. 
#### The second line should contain the result of float division,a/b.

#### No rounding or formatting is necessary.

#### Example

#### a = 3
#### b = 5

#### The result of the integer division 3//5 = 0 
#### The result of the float division is 3/5 = 0.6 

#### Print:

#### 0
#### 0.6
---
### Solution:-
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(a//b)
print(a/b)
```
